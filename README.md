Since you have it cloned, just run: "yarn" or "yarn install"

After that, just run: "yarn dev"

Finally you can see the app running in: http://localhost:3000

There are 2 routes, the base route is the original app link, that list all parts. The second one is
http://localhost:3000/parts/some_existing_part, and there you will be able to see a specific part when you select it
by clicking on table
